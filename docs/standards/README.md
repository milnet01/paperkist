# Standards for Paperkist

**The standards are global and are read in place**, at
`~/.claude/standards/`. There is exactly one copy of each, shared by
every project on this machine. Nothing copies them here.

`~/.claude/standards/README.md` is the index and owns the three cases: a
project follows the global set, overrides one with a deltas-only file, or
owns a standard outright.

## This directory

Two things belong here, and nothing else:

1. **Overrides** — a deltas-only file naming where this project departs
   from a global standard, and why.
2. **Standards this project owns outright** — a rule that is genuinely
   about this project and has no global equivalent.

If this directory is empty, this project follows the global set
unmodified. That is the common case and needs no file to say so.

**A copy of a global standard does not belong here.** Two copies are two
standards that will disagree, and the one nobody is looking at will be
the one being followed.
